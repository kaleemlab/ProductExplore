# Expo and React Native Boilerplate
Boilerplate to build Cross-Platform Apps with Expo and React Native

  ## What are you going to find in this boilerplate
                                                       
  ### Expo
              
  [Expo](https://expo.io/) is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Androi  d, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React.
  
      
  ### React Native for Web
                              
  [React Native for Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) makes it possible to run Re  act Native components and APIs on the web using React DOM.
  
  It was included in [Expo SDK 33](https://blog.expo.io/expo-sdk-v33-0-0-is-now-available-52d1c99dfe4c), so one less thing to worry about.
  
  ### React Navigation
                          
  [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) adss routing and navigation to your React Nati  ve apps.
  
  ### Electron
                  
  [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) let you build cross platform desktop apps with JavaScri  pt, HTML, and CSS.
  
      
  ### Easy Peasy
                    
  [Easy Peasy](https://easy-peasy.vercel.app/) is an abstraction of Redux, providing a reimagined   API that focuses on developer experience.
   
  ### React Native Async Storage
                                    
  [React Native Async Storage](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage) is an   asynchronous, persistent, key-value storage system for React Native.
   
  ### React Native Paper
                            
  Although, I use it in most of my Apps, sometimes I prefer to use my own components. Anyway, if   you prefer to start with a collection of customizable and production-ready Cross-Platform compo  nents for React Native, I highly recommend to you add to your project with:
  
  ~~~bash
  $ expo install react-native-paper
  ~~~                                  
         
  ## How to try this boilerplate
                                    
  You can download and run the repository from my Github account: [jferrer/expo-boilerplate](https://github.com/jferrer/expo-boilerplate)
  
  ### Clone the repo and install dependencies:
  
  ~~~bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/jferrer/expo-boilerplate.git
  $ cd expo-boilerplate

  ### Run for Web & Native:
  
  ~~~bash
  $ expo start
  ~~~
  
  ### Run for Desktop:

  Inside, you'll see the basic configuration and screens to start an App:
  
  - Typical Tab Bar navigation like Facebook or Instagram
  - Action & Form Screen to add elements to the Store
  - List Screen
